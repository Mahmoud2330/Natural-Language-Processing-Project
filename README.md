# Natural-Language-Processing-Project
Developed an NLP model to classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative. Using a balanced dataset of 1,000 reviews, text preprocessing and Bag-of-Words transformation were applied. The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier achieved 86% accuracy. Future improvements include expanding the dataset and refining preprocessing.
